# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This project involves creating a browser-based JavaScript quiz application, showcasing dynamically updated HTML and CSS facilitated by JavaScript code and implemented through Web API.

Upon initiation, users can begin the quiz by clicking the start button. A timer commences, and successive multiple-choice questions are presented. Answering a question incorrectly results in a deduction of ten seconds from the timer. The quiz concludes when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero. Participants can then input their initials, and their scores are stored.

Furthermore, the system retains and displays the highest score achieved by each individual in a designated highest scores list.

The following animation demonstrates how the application works.
